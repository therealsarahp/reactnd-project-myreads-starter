re-re-re-write of the project, takes out some unneccessary complications of state for a more straightforward app that only loads from api on main screen, move to function is decoupled from a value state attribute as well,

reloads/refresh to state is made when books are moved


App could probably funciton wihtou having "shelf" as a seperate attribute, but I' did several overhauls aon this and I'm rather ready to put it down now that it's working.
