Project can be downloaded and launched locally by downloading files and then installing and running npm 

Project pulls from a dummy API provided by udacity and displays three book lists with books determined by their status as "currently reading", "want to read", and "read". Shelf is an attribute on the book data object and can be updated using the arrow/select funciton. 

Project has working search functions and ability to select books from search to home page. 

Project utilizes react router to display two seperate pages and moves between pages with links. 


re-re-re-write of the project, takes out some unneccessary complications of state for a more straightforward app that only loads from api on main screen, move to function is decoupled from a value state attribute as well,

reloads/refresh to state is made when books are moved
